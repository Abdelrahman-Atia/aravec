## AraVec
AraVec is a pre-trained distributed word representation (word embedding) open source project which comes to enhance the Arabic NLP research
community with free to use and powerful word embeddings models built with one of the most popular word embedding techniques, Word2Vec.
AraVec comes in its first version with six different word embeddings models built on top of three different Arabic content domains;
1. Twitter tweets
2. World Wide Web pages
3. Wikipedia Arabic articles
by total tokens of more than 3,300,000,000.
Word embeddings models became one of the most powerful tools required by many researchers especially the Arabic NLP interesting researchers who are facing
a high difficulty to reach the sufficient open resources and that what pushes us to work on this project to fill like these gaps.
